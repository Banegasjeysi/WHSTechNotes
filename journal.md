Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

Look, I’ll be real the new no phones in school rule? Kind of a pain at first. Like, who actually wants to be cut off from their group chats and memes during a boring english class? Not me, obviously. But, weirdly enough, it’s not all bad. Actually, it’s kinda working.
Ever since they started cracking down, I’ve noticed people actually looking up during class, not just doomscrolling under the desk. Wild, right? Teachers don’t have to battle the endless ping of notifications anymore, so everyone’s less twitchy. Conversations are, like, actual conversations. People are present in a way I forgot was possible. Guess it turns out, if you yank the biggest distraction out of the room, people pay more attention. Who knew?
Yeah, it sucks not being able to text your mom about lunch or check TikTok when class drags. But honestly? That’s a small price to pay for not having your brain split in five directions all day. Plus, the vibe in school feels more alive, people are joking around, actually talking. Sure, I miss my phone sometimes, but I gotta admit things are better this way.

Computer science is valuable in the field of engineering. For example, in the video "Computer Science is Changing Evrything", engineers use computer programming to desing and test bridges before they are built. This allows them to simulate different conditions and ensure safety without risking real lives or materials. By using computer models engineers can solve complex problems faster and more accurately than by hand. Therefore, computer science helps engineers create better, safer, and more efficient structures, making it an essential akill in the proffesion.
