Look, I’ll be real the new no phones in school rule? Kind of a pain at first. Like, who actually wants to be cut off from their group chats and memes during a boring english class? Not me, obviously. But, weirdly enough, it’s not all bad. Actually, it’s kinda working.
Ever since they started cracking down, I’ve noticed people actually looking up during class, not just doomscrolling under the desk. Wild, right? Teachers don’t have to battle the endless ping of notifications anymore, so everyone’s less twitchy. Conversations are, like, actual conversations. People are present in a way I forgot was possible. Guess it turns out, if you yank the biggest distraction out of the room, people pay more attention. Who knew?
Yeah, it sucks not being able to text your mom about lunch or check TikTok when class drags. But honestly? That’s a small price to pay for not having your brain split in five directions all day. Plus, the vibe in school feels more alive, people are joking around, actually talking. Sure, I miss my phone sometimes, but I gotta admit things are better this way.

Computer science is valuable in the field of engineering. For example, in the video "Computer Science is Changing Evrything", engineers use computer programming to desing and test bridges before they are built. This allows them to simulate different conditions and ensure safety without risking real lives or materials. By using computer models engineers can solve complex problems faster and more accurately than by hand. Therefore, computer science helps engineers create better, safer, and more efficient structures, making it an essential akill in the proffesion.

I beieve that working in a virtual store for real money can be a good idea for the future of jobs because it offers flexible opportunities and new ways to earn income. For example, IKEA'S experiment with a virtual store inside Roblox allows people to earn 16.10 per hour doing tasks like restocking shelves and helping customers, similar to real world jobs. This evidence shows that virtual work can provide genuine employment opportunities  that are accessible from home, making jobs more flexible and inclusive, which is beneficial for future job markets. Additionally, virtual work can help people develop new skills relevant to digital environments, preparing them for evolving indutries. However, it is important to consider potential downsides, such as reduced face to face interaction and the need for re;iable internet access. Overall, embracing virtual work models like IKEA'S could expand employment options and adapt to technological advancements, shaping a more versatile job landscape. People repeat it because it's fun and connects them

The phrase "6,7" likely signifies a secret code or inside joke among students. It's used to convey a specific feeling or situation, perhaps excitement or agreement. The mood is likely lighthearted and playful, creating a sense of belonging. People repeat it because it's fun and connects them. The tone is often playful, and it could be a shared joke. It becomes a way to express a feeling.

If I were in charge of my school, I would implement polices that allow students to use cell phones and chromebooks for educational purposes, such as research and learning apps, but restrict their use during lessons to minimize distractions. AI tools like ChatGPT would be permitted for homework help and projects, encouraging responsible use. Non educational games would be blocked, but learning games would be allowed. This would help students focus better and use technology to learn. It would also teach students how to use tech responsibly. These rules would foster a focused learning environment, enhance engagement with educational content, and develop responsible technology habits among students.

Part 1:
Prompt: Create an interactive slide deck that teaches middle school students (grades 6–8) about Newton’s Three Laws of Motion. The slides should be colorful, engaging, and easy to understand, using simple language and visual examples like animations or illustrations of real-world scenarios (a skateboarder, a soccer ball, or a rocket).

Include:
A title slide with the topic and a fun science-themed background.
One slide for each of Newton’s three laws, with a short explanation and a visual example.
An interactive quiz slide at the end with multiple-choice questions to test understanding.
A summary slide that reviews all three laws in a clear, memorable way.
Use a bright, modern design style with icons, motion graphics, and bold headings to keep students interested.

Part 2: Reflection
My prompt was designed to help Canva AI create an interactive and visually appealing lesson about Newton’s Three Laws of Motion for middle school students. AI understood the structure well and built a slide deck that included clear sections for each law, along with visuals that matched the examples I described. The colorful layout and quiz feature worked especially well to make the content engaging. However, some of the text explanations were too advanced for the target age group, and the quiz questions could have been more interactive. To improve my prompt, I would specify the reading level and request simpler phrasing and more dynamic quiz options. Being skilled at prompt engineering is valuable because it helps professionals communicate clearly with AI tools, saving time and producing more effective, creative results in education and other industries.

Topic: The Solar System
Audience: 4th grade students
Project: Interactive slide deck
Instructions:
Create a colorful, engaging slide deck that teaches 4th graders about the Solar System. Each slide should focus on one planet, including a fun fact, a simple illustration, and a question or interactive element (like “Guess which planet is the hottest!”). The first slide should introduce the Solar System, and the last slide should have a short quiz with multiple-choice questions. Use kid-friendly language, bright colors, and playful fonts. Add icons or images for each planet and make sure the slides are easy to read and visually appealing.

 Reflection
My prompt was designed to help Canva AI create an interactive slide deck that introduces 4th graders to the Solar System in a fun and engaging way. I specified the audience, the format (slide deck), and the style (colorful, kid-friendly, interactive). Canva AI understood my instructions and generated slides for each planet, using bright colors and simple language. The inclusion of fun facts and interactive questions made the content more engaging for young learners. The images and icons for each planet worked well and made the slides visually appealing. However, some of the interactive elements were less creative than I hoped, and a few slides needed more variety in layout. To improve my prompt, I could give more specific examples of interactive activities or request different slide layouts for each planet. Being good at prompt engineering is valuable because it helps people communicate clearly with AI tools, making it easier to create effective educational materials, solve problems, and stand out in tech-related careers where AI is becoming more important.

When the SNAP program runs out of funding, millions of families lose access to the financial support they rely on to buy groceries. This is a major problem because it directly affects low-income households, children, and seniors who depend on SNAP to afford nutritious meals. Without it, food insecurity increases, and many people may go hungry or be forced to choose cheaper, less healthy options. Technology could help by creating apps or websites that connect people to nearby food banks, community kitchens, or local stores offering discounts and free meals. However, challenges include limited internet access, lack of smartphones, and concerns about sharing personal information online. If designing a solution, a tool called “FoodLink” could be created to map nearby food resources, send real-time alerts about available meals, and allow users to request help anonymously. This would make it easier for people to find food quickly and safely during funding disruptions.

Drone programmers are essential for drone authonomy, earning around $87,000 in Texas, but I am not sure if i would want to do it because i am more interested in other fields.

This role is crucial as drone programmers develop the software that enables drones to fly themselves and complete tasks. For instance, code written by these professionals allows drones to autonomously navigate complex environments or collect specific data. According to ZipRecruiter, the average salary for a drone programmer in Texas is approximately $87,000 annually. To enter this field, a bachelo's degree in computer science and proficiency in programming languages like C++ or Python are generally required. Wile the technological aspect is fascinating, my personal career interests lie in different areas.

A self-driving car might fail to recognize a stopped school bus because the sensors or cameras misinterpret the flashing lights or the extended stop sign, especially in bad lighting or crowded traffic. Sometimes the AI can also confuse the bus with another large vehicle and not treat it as a high-priority hazard. Another challenge is that the system might rely too heavily on map data instead of reacting fast enough to what it sees in real time. If I were a programmer on the Waymo team, I would add stronger rules that force the car to always stop whenever a bus’s lights are flashing, no matter what. I would also improve the camera recognition so the car can identify stop signs on buses from farther away and even in low visibility. Adding a backup emergency-stop logic specifically for school buses would help prevent the car from moving until the entire situation is safe.

Winter break is one of the most anticipated times of the year, offering a chance to relax, recharge, and spend time with loved ones after months of hard work. This year, the plan is to balance rest, productivity, and enjoyment by combining family time, personal growth, and a bit of adventure.The first part of winter break will be dedicated to spending quality time with my family. The holiday season brings everyone together, and it’s the perfect opportunity to reconnect with mr family that lives far away. Decorating the house, baking cookies, and watching classic holiday movies will create a warm and festive break. Family dinners and game nights will make the break feel even more special, reminding everyone of the importance of togetherness.After the holidays, the focus will shift toward personal goals. Winter break provides a great opportunity to catch up on reading, start a new hobby, or learn something new. Setting aside time each day to read a few chapters of a book or practice a creative skill like painting or photography will make the break both relaxing and enriching. It’s also a good time to reflect on the past year and set goals for the upcoming one, helping to start the new year with motivation and clarity.Finally, a bit of adventure will make the break memorable.Taking a short road trip, or simply exploring local winter festivals can bring excitement and new experiences. Even a walk through a park.

 Autcraft was created to provide a safe, welcoming online space for autistic children and their families who were often bullied or excluded inregular online games.It solved the problem of harassment and lack of moderation by using clear rules, active moderators, and a supportive community culture. Safe spaces are needed on the internet because unmoderated spaces can lead to bullying, hate speech, emotional harm, and people feeling unsafe or unwelcome. Autcraft's design choices, such as strict rules and constant moderation, help protect players and allow them to be themselves without fear. Developer have a responsibility to create and protect these spaces because users should not have to defend themselves alone. If developers ignore safety and inclusion, communities can become toxic and drive people away. Other examples of safe online spaces include moderated Discord servers and child friendly platforms with strong safety rules.

One way technology can help create fairness by providing equal access to educational resources through online platforms. This matters because students from different backgrounds can learn at there own pace, regardless of where  they live or there family income. An example of this could be free online courses offered by organizations like Khan Academy, which allow anyone with internet access to study subjects that might not be available at their school. By making high quality education accessible to all, technology helps close the achievement gap between priviliged and undepriviliged communities. This use of technology ensures that everyone has the opportunity to succeed based on their effort and ability, not just their circumstances. When people have equal access to knowledge, they are empowered to advocate for themselves and others promoting a more just society. In this way, technology becomes a powelful tool for fairness and social progress.

The test I took was the MAP test, covering reading, language, and algebra 1, and i feel i did pretty good. I'm feeling positive about my performance because I believe I demostrated a good understanding of the material precented in each test. While I'm still waiting for the official results, my general feeling is that I performed well on the reading comprehension, language, and algebra 1. To be honest I feel like the tests were not challenging at all, but im going to say that i did struggle a little when i was doing the language test because the some of the stories were too long and i kept forgetting everything when it was time to answer my questions.

Proffesional behavior in shared space is important because classrooms, offices, and workplaces are environments where many people must coexist comfortably and productively. In a shared space, people should be mindful of how their actions seem small or unintentional. Personal hygine and self care essential in environments because they directly impact the comfort and well being of others. Maintaining cleanliness, wearing clean clothes, and managing body odor help create a space where people feel respected and at ease. When hygine is neglected, it can cause discomfort, distraction, or embarrassment for others, which can interfere with learning or work. Long conversations, strong smells, or distracting behaviors can significantly affect others' ability to focus or feel comfortable. Excessive noise can interrupt concentration, strong scents can cause headaches or nausea, and distracting actions can amke it difficut for others to stay engaged. These bahaviors may increase stress and reduce overall productivity in shared spaces. Reasobale expectations for proffesional behavior incluse practicing good hygine, using respectful languague, keeping an appropiate volume when speaking, respecting personal space, showing emotional self control, and being aware of one's surroundings. Proffesional behavior matters because it createsan environment built on mutual respect, safety, and cooperantion, allowing everyone to perform at their best. Self regulation is important because is allows individuals to manage their voice, reactions, and h=behavior appropiately in different situations. In school and future workplaces, the ability to stay calm, handle emotions maturely, and respond thoughtfully helps build trust and demostrates responsability and professionalism. One habit I can work on is being more aware of my volume when speaking in shared spaces. By controlling how loudly I talk, I can help ensure that others are able to focus and feel comfortable. Improving this habit shows respect for others and contributes to a more positive shared environment.

I dont really enjoy football because I find the games too long and im not very interested in sports. However, I did watch Super Bowl LX this year. What really stood out to me was Bad Bunny's halftime performance, which i thought was amazing. I specially loved the positive message he shared with everyone during his performance. I loved the way he brought up all the flags and that he brought part of his culture to us and he showed how us Latinos/Hispanic people enjoy our parties, with that performance he maked sure to give everyone a message that it doesnt matter what race you are, we can always stay united, and that we are all the same.
