Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

Look, I’ll be real the new no phones in school rule? Kind of a pain at first. Like, who actually wants to be cut off from their group chats and memes during a boring english class? Not me, obviously. But, weirdly enough, it’s not all bad. Actually, it’s kinda working.
Ever since they started cracking down, I’ve noticed people actually looking up during class, not just doomscrolling under the desk. Wild, right? Teachers don’t have to battle the endless ping of notifications anymore, so everyone’s less twitchy. Conversations are, like, actual conversations. People are present in a way I forgot was possible. Guess it turns out, if you yank the biggest distraction out of the room, people pay more attention. Who knew?
Yeah, it sucks not being able to text your mom about lunch or check TikTok when class drags. But honestly? That’s a small price to pay for not having your brain split in five directions all day. Plus, the vibe in school feels more alive, people are joking around, actually talking. Sure, I miss my phone sometimes, but I gotta admit things are better this way.

Computer science is valuable in the field of engineering. For example, in the video "Computer Science is Changing Evrything", engineers use computer programming to desing and test bridges before they are built. This allows them to simulate different conditions and ensure safety without risking real lives or materials. By using computer models engineers can solve complex problems faster and more accurately than by hand. Therefore, computer science helps engineers create better, safer, and more efficient structures, making it an essential akill in the proffesion.

My AI project proposes a personalized learning assistant that adapts educational content and teaching methods to each student's unique needs and space. This AI would responsibily analyze learning pattern and performance data, ensuring ethical data handling and privacy. It directly adresses the challenge by significantly enhancing education, offering tailored support to students, and freeing up teeachers for more complex tasks. The project is creative in its adaptive learning algorithms and realistic given current advancements in natural languague processing and machine learning. Such an assistant would be incredibly useful by making education more equitable and effective, providing immediate feedback and customized resources.

I beieve that working in a virtual store for real money can be a good idea for the future of jobs because it offers flexible opportunities and new ways to earn income. For example, IKEA'S experiment with a virtual store inside Roblox allows people to earn 16.10 per hour doing tasks like restocking shelves and helping customers, similar to real world jobs. This evidence shows that virtual work can provide genuine employment opportunities  that are accessible from home, making jobs more flexible and inclusive, which is beneficial for future job markets. Additionally, virtual work can help people develop new skills relevant to digital environments, preparing them for evolving indutries. However, it is important to consider potential downsides, such as reduced face to face interaction and the need for re;iable internet access. Overall, embracing virtual work models like IKEA'S could expand employment options and adapt to technological advancements, shaping a more versatile job landscape. People repeat it because it's fun and connects them

The phrase "6,7" likely signifies a secret code or inside joke among students. It's used to convey a specific feeling or situation, perhaps excitement or agreement. The mood is likely lighthearted and playful, creating a sense of belonging. People repeat it because it's fun and connects them. The tone is often playful, and it could be a shared joke. It becomes a way to express a feeling.

If I were in charge of my school, I would implement polices that allow students to use cell phones and chromebooks for educational purposes, such as research and learning apps, but restrict their use during lessons to minimize distractions. AI tools like ChatGPT would be permitted for homework help and projects, encouraging responsible use. Non educational games would be blocked, but learning games would be allowed. This would help students focus better and use technology to learn. It would also teach students how to use tech responsibly. These rules would foster a focused learning environment, enhance engagement with educational content, and develop responsible technology habits among students.

Topic: The Solar System
Audience: 4th grade students
Project: Interactive slide deck
Instructions:
Create a colorful, engaging slide deck that teaches 4th graders about the Solar System. Each slide should focus on one planet, including a fun fact, a simple illustration, and a question or interactive element (like “Guess which planet is the hottest!”). The first slide should introduce the Solar System, and the last slide should have a short quiz with multiple-choice questions. Use kid-friendly language, bright colors, and playful fonts. Add icons or images for each planet and make sure the slides are easy to read and visually appealing.

 Reflection
My prompt was designed to help Canva AI create an interactive slide deck that introduces 4th graders to the Solar System in a fun and engaging way. I specified the audience, the format (slide deck), and the style (colorful, kid-friendly, interactive). Canva AI understood my instructions and generated slides for each planet, using bright colors and simple language. The inclusion of fun facts and interactive questions made the content more engaging for young learners. The images and icons for each planet worked well and made the slides visually appealing. However, some of the interactive elements were less creative than I hoped, and a few slides needed more variety in layout. To improve my prompt, I could give more specific examples of interactive activities or request different slide layouts for each planet. Being good at prompt engineering is valuable because it helps people communicate clearly with AI tools, making it easier to create effective educational materials, solve problems, and stand out in tech-related careers where AI is becoming more important.

When the SNAP program runs out of funding, millions of families lose access to the financial support they rely on to buy groceries. This is a major problem because it directly affects low-income households, children, and seniors who depend on SNAP to afford nutritious meals. Without it, food insecurity increases, and many people may go hungry or be forced to choose cheaper, less healthy options. Technology could help by creating apps or websites that connect people to nearby food banks, community kitchens, or local stores offering discounts and free meals. However, challenges include limited internet access, lack of smartphones, and concerns about sharing personal information online. If designing a solution, a tool called “FoodLink” could be created to map nearby food resources, send real-time alerts about available meals, and allow users to request help anonymously. This would make it easier for people to find food quickly and safely during funding disruptions.
